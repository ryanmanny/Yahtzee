# Yahtzee
The classic. A Yahtzee game I made for a Computer Science class.
Has a few extra features beyond the norm, such as ASCII dice and supports an infinite number of players.
Functions as closely to the Yahtzee electronic game as I could manage.

# TODO
- Implement high score board
- Let players play concurrently
- Add an AI player (greedy is a given, but how to implement saving dice?)
